## Introduction

In this tutorial you will learn how to make a About You page using HTML and a preview of CSS.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create the HTML File

Open your code editor and create a file named `index.html`. Add the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>All About Me</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  Hello World!
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 1B
Inside the <body></body> tag, use <h1></h1> to put your name!

It should look like this:
```
<body>
  <h1>My name is Katelyn</h1>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

### 1C
To make a sub header we will create another tag called h2 
Write down the school you go to under it.

It should look like this:

```
<body>
  <h1>My name is Katelyn</h1>
  <h2>I go to University of Hawaii At Manoa</h2>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

### 1D

Now create a paragraph about yourself! Talk about your favorite food, your favorite animal and why you joined this class!
You will put this under a <p></p> 

It should look like this:

```
<body>
  <h1>My name is Katelyn</h1>
  <h2>I go to University of Hawaii At Manoa</h2>
  <p>My favorite type of food is seafood! I love crab, lobster rolls and especially sushi! My favorite animal is a giraffe and a husky. I joined this class because it is super fun!</p>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

### 2 Add an image

Add an image of your favorite animal. you are going to put <img src=" "/> and in the quotation marks copy and paste a link of an image of your favorite animal. 

```
<body>
  <h1>My name is Katelyn</h1>
  <h2>I go to University of Hawaii At Manoa</h2>
  <p>My favorite type of food is seafood! I love crab, lobster rolls and especially sushi! My favorite animal is a giraffe and a husky. I joined this class because it is super fun!</p>
  <img src="https://www.google.com/imgres?q=giraffe%20animal&imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Flionhabitatranch.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F09%2FMeet-Ozzie-2.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Flionhabitatranch.org%2Fanimals%2Fmeet-ozzie-the-giraffe%2F&docid=zEYiYylsmA5eRM&tbnid=5mxxKuPd_n-L5M&vet=12ahUKEwjQurKTpueJAxXiMzQIHbsCAF0QM3oECFkQAA..i&w=900&h=1200&hcb=2&ved=2ahUKEwjQurKTpueJAxXiMzQIHbsCAF0QM3oECFkQAA"/>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

### 2. Create the CSS File

Create a file named `styles.css` and add the following code to style your webpage:

```css
picturesize {
  width: 25px;
  height: 25px;
}
```
This adjusts the pixel size of the animal image

### 2b. Size image
Go back to your index.html file and add "className="picturesize"" before the 'src'.

```
<img className="picturesize" src="https://www.google.com/imgres?q=giraffe%20animal&imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Flionhabitatranch.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F09%2FMeet-Ozzie-2.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Flionhabitatranch.org%2Fanimals%2Fmeet-ozzie-the-giraffe%2F&docid=zEYiYylsmA5eRM&tbnid=5mxxKuPd_n-L5M&vet=12ahUKEwjQurKTpueJAxXiMzQIHbsCAF0QM3oECFkQAA..i&w=900&h=1200&hcb=2&ved=2ahUKEwjQurKTpueJAxXiMzQIHbsCAF0QM3oECFkQAA"/>
```
